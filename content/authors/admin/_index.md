      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science Engineer currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer, where I am responsible for transforming research papers into AI-oriented applications, currently heavily focused in Generative AI using Stable Diffusion (LoRas, Controlnets, ip-adapters, etc). My work involves delivering high-quality, tested code in Python, which is exposed through REST APIs using frameworks such as FastAPI. Additionally, I arrange these processes in pipelines using frameworks such as Airflow and deploy them on cloud services such as AWS and Docker. I've got 5+ years experience as an AI/ML developer creating projects such as Virtual Clothes TryOn,student desertion dashboard, WhatsApp Chatbots (currently serving 150.000+ users), and software for Financial Companies.
